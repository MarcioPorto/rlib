# rlib

`rlib` is a small deep reinforcement learning library with implementations of popular deep RL algorithms. Each algorithm is highly modular and customizable, making this library a great choice for anyone who wants to test the performance of different algorithms in the same environment. `rlib` uses PyTorch as the library of choice for its initial version, but support for other libraries like TensorFlow are on the roadmap for the future.
